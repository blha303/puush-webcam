puush-webcam
============

A cross-platform Python puush webcam image uploader, via pygame.

Set the environment variable `PUUSH_KEY` to your API key (available from the puush site, or in the Settings page of the client, or in the URL when you click on My Account in the context menu).

Also, if you're using a puush proxy/alternative instance, add `PUUSH_DOMAIN` pointing to the full URL for that (i.e `http://blha303.biz`). If you're unsure if you need this second part, you probably don't.

Install [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) and [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) from the websites, then use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the rest.
